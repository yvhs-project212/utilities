# The `utilities` repository

The `utilities` repo is a home for useful software tools that aren't
actually competition robot code.

## motor_testing

The `motor_testing` directory contains WPILib generated code which will
turn a single motor on and off, in order to verify that the motor is
working correctly at a very basic level.  If a motor fails this simple
test, it should probably be trashed.
